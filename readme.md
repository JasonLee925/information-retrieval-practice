1. To generate the answer files, run:

    ```bash
    python3 {filename}.py
    ```

    - *{filename}* allows: `q1_3`,`q2_3`, and `q3_3`.
    - The existing answer txt file will be removed, and the program will recreate a new one.

<!-- 2. A few words I'd like to share with the teaching team:
    - This is a data science related unit not a CS or software development unit.
    - You may suggest that students program in OOP style (for a better code management, which I agree), but you should not make this as a mandatory requirement, especially when you are not familier with the concept.
    - I disagree a specific OOP requirement mentioned in the assignment specification. IT IS NOT THE BEST PRACTICE, and I find it unfair to be marked because of this.  -->
